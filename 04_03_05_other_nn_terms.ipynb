    "## Recursive neural networks\n",
    "- Every NN so far has been in a feedforward context, clear directionality (flow) to the network\n",
    "- **Recursive neural networks (RNN):** data runs through nodes or neurons more than once\n",
    "- Useful for drawing out more complex relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolutional neural networks\n",
    "- So far, neurons linked together in grid-like structure, represented using matrices\n",
    "- Link between layers is simple matrix multiplication\n",
    "- **Convolutions** are an added level of complexity by linking matrices together via linear equations\n",
    "- Linear transformations are specialized and can have a large impact on the network\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep learning\n",
    "- Defined as a neural network with several hidden layers\n",
    "- No hard threshold for number of layers to qualify as 'deep'\n",
    "- Downsides: added complexity (increased runtime), increasingly black box\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinforcement learning\n",
    "- Model gets feedback from its environment or system\n",
    "- Model tries actions at random and observes the feedback it receives\n",
    "- Learns a way to operate through a series of events that generates the most positive feedback\n",
    "- Useful for automating tasks (video games, driving)\n",
    "- Requires different kind of data (not readily available) and significant engineering background to properly link feedback loop"
