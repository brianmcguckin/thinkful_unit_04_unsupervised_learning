    "## Unsupervised neural networks\n",
    "Instead of predicting a labeled value (supervised NNs), used for a variety of tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature extraction\n",
    "- Translates data from one set of features to a new set of different features\n",
    "- New feature set is usually smaller and more suitable for further processing\n",
    "- Example: taking series of pixels and translating them to lines, edges, or curves\n",
    "- **Modeling pipeline:** process where extracted features are fed into another model for predictive purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM)\n",
    "- Similar to single layer perceptrons but without a specified output to train on\n",
    "- Works in two layers\n",
    "    - 1st layer: inputs (visible nodes)\n",
    "    - 2nd layer: hidden layer, new set of derived features\n",
    "- Aims to extract patterns by finding common aggregations within the data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Autoencoders\n",
    "- Have an additional layer of output compared to RBMs\n",
    "- Often defined by the number of features they output\n",
    "    - Can have the same number of input & output features, used to better learn the existing features\n",
    "    - Can have fewer output features, compressing the original data\n",
    "    - Can have more output features, method to expand the data\n",
    "- Same number of input/output features translated through a hidden layer with fewer features\n",
    "    - Feature regeneration, improves robustness & groups redundancies\n",
    "    - Output can be the same number as input, but in a better state for modeling\n",
    "- Autoencoders are most often used early in the modeling pipeline for pre-training NNs\n",
    "    - Uses hidden middle layer generated by the autoencoder as input for another NN layer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised NN usages\n",
    "- Generally used in specific contexts\n",
    "- Image recognition\n",
    "    - RBM is valuable for this task\n",
    "    - RBM is the only unsupervised NN in sklearn\n",
    "    - For more, there is companion package skimage"
