    "# 01 Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "- Supervised learning requires information about the process and an observable, recordable outcome of interest\n",
    "- This is not the case with unsupervised learning\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning looks through available data and allows something to be done or said about it\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering\n",
    "- A clustering algorithm goes over your set of variables and groups observations it thinks are related\n",
    "- Typically you tell it how many groups (clusters) it is allowed to generate, algorithm goes over the data creating groups that minimize some cost function\n",
    "- Sometimes the algorithm can find the number of groups on its own\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Importance\n",
    "- PCA is an unsupervised technique for finding which variables tend to be most influential\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Networks\n",
    "- Can function as either supervised or unsupervised\n",
    "- Unsupervised neural networks important for discovering latent variables\n",
    "    - Latent variables are impactful but not explicitly defined in the initial dataset\n",
    "    - Example: image recognition\n"

    "## Evaluation\n",
    "- Evaluation is perhaps the biggest difficulty in unsupervised learning\n",
    "- Since there is no outcome variable, defining accuracy isn't possible since there's nothing to evaluate against\n",
    "- Approaches for dealing with this:\n",
    "    - Volatility: stability to changes, exclusion, or addition of some data is good\n",
    "    - Testing: test what you intended to do and see if it works\n",
    "## Complexity\n",
    "- Since evaluation is hard to define so is a stopping condition\n",
    "- Can lead to increasingly complex and resource consuming models\n",
    "- Imposing limitations can help keep structures simple\n",
    "- Some models can perform very strong while being complex (neural networks)\n"
